## [1.3.0-rc1] - To be released

With the 1.3.0 release we're introducing a better way for Paazl to store customer address information in Magento. By default, Magento handles the street information in a single field and uses multiple lines to store the information. This is considered suboptimal as it causes a lot of problems with compatibility. New separate Customer attributes are introduced: street_name, house_number, house_number_addition.

*EE Only: If you're already using custom Customer attributes (e.g. `house number`), make sure it follows Paazl's exact naming convention (it are varchar fields).*

- All UI components that have address fields are replaced with the new customer attributes (frontend / backend).
- All existing addresses are automatically converted to the new format when they are loaded.
- To maintain 100% compatibility, before saving the customer address a new flattened value is stored in the original street attribute.

### Improvements / Bug fixes
A lot of bug fixes and small improvements are included in this release:
- The product matrix is now configurable from A-ZZ instead of A-Z.
- Added option to enable the postcode validation (disabled by default due to UI issues with addresses outside the Netherlands, better UI planned for a future release).
- Checkout field sort order set to: Street Number, House Number, House Number Addition, Postcode, City, State, Country
- Solve issue in the cart where the tax would not be calculated properly because Paazl expects a full address instead of only a postcode. (Reported by ISM e-Company)
- Solve issue in the cart where filling in your state would throw a JS error.
- Solve issue where saving a customer address would throw an exception. CE Only
- Solve issue where a reorder would throw an exception. (Reported by Guapa)
- Solve issue where having a different configuration per website would cause issues (Reported by Guapa).

### Known Issues / Limitations
- 'Admin Panel Order Create' and 'Frontend multishipping' does not support Paazl Perfect, only basic functionality is supported.
- ~~When the cron job is trying to communicate orders to Paazl and Paazl throws an error for a single order, the rest of the orders wont be processed.~~ Solved in rc2
- ~~Core Bug: Multi Address Checkout: New address does not show house number.~~ (Ticket #03212624) Solved in rc2
- Core Bug: Customer Address field are not update for order edit address.  (Ticket #03212673)
    - Backend, open order, choose ‘edit’ at billing address. change the house number, field is not updated for the order.
    - If you order as logged-in customer and choose for a different billing address on the payment step then it does not save the house number.
